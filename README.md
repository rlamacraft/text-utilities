# text-utilities
A bunch of simple utility programs written in C for viewing and manipulating text files; just like the standard cat, less, ed, and others.

## cat.c
A simple program just like `cat`, in that it prints to stdout the contents of the file given to it.
- To compile do `gcc cat.c -o bin/cat`, or other similar in your c compiler of choice.
- To run do `./cat <file>`.
